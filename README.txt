Use Support hours to give yourself and your clients insights on the status of pre-paid work.

== Description ==

Small development task can have a huge impact on your time as a developer. How much time did your customer bought, how much time did you spent on tasks, how much time do you have left to spent? Not to mention all the effort to report it all back to your customer, every time you do something for them.
No more with Support Hours. Support Hours offers a simple interface for you, the web professional, to add pre-paid hours, log spent time and give a beautiful overview to your customer of how much time they have left. It even notices when the support hours are almost spent.
